# Hangman Application
## Introduction

Welcome to the Hangman Application, a web-based game designed to provide a fun and interactive way to play the classic game of Hangman. This application is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and is deployed on Render for easy accessibility. The game allows players to guess letters or the word itself, with a visual representation of the hangman as the game progresses.
